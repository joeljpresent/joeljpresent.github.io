# Salut, le monde !

![Ma bannière](https://i.imgur.com/I8IGDGc.png)

My name is **Joël J. Présent** and I am currently a student at EPITA, graduate school of computer science.

I am passionate of software development, especially in Rust, but also with C++, Java and TypeScript.
I have a few projects hosted here on GitHub (such as the [`pseudolocalize`][pseudolocalize] crate), and I am currently helping translating [the Rust book][rust-book-fr] from English to French.

I don't have much time to work on this website right now, but I plan to expand it in the future.
For now, you can take a look at my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin] if you want more info about my I.T. experience.
